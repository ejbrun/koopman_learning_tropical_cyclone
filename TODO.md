# TODOs

- [x] conversion of tropical cyclone data into pytorch dataloader framework
- [x] test KNF on tropical cyclone data
- [x] visualize predicted curves from klearn and KNF
- [ ] implement model prediction for time series of arbitrary length (at the moment a certain context length of the dataset is fixed, koopman kernel model is only able to predict for time series of that length) 
- [ ] improve KNF, e.g. exchange the attention mechanism with a more efficient kernel attention mechanism
